This package does not contain the sources used to build the resulting packages. 
It build-depends on the binutils source and uses that (via the
binutils-source package)

All the supported binutils cross-targets are built by this package.

To change the set of target archtectures built edit TARGET_LIST in the
rules file and regenerate the control file with 
debian/rules control
